# Reviewing Functions
- I understand how functions use arguments and parameters to execute operations. 
    - Parameters act as placeholders for the values in the argument.
    - The argument holds the actual values that get passed to the function.
        - If a value isn't passed, parameters can hold "default values" to be executed instead. 
- I still get disoriented, so the review was helpful.
    - It doesn't help that there are so many variations of code that basically does the same thing.
    - Adding arrays and loops compound my confusion. 

# About Local Storage
## localStorage
- Data is stored indefinitely unless deleted using methods like removeItem() or clear().
- The data is saved across browser sessions, even if you close the browser and reopen it.
- It is best for data that you want to keep between visits, such as user preferences or settings.
## sessionStorage:
- Data is tied to the page session.
- Data is saved only as long as the browser is open to that page or tab.
- Once the tab or window is closed, the data is lost.
- It is useful for temporary data that only needs to be available while a user is on a page, such as temporary form data.
